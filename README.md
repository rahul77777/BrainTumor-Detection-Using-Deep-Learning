 ## Convolution Neural Network(CNN)
 
 Deep Learning has proven to be a awfully powerful tool attributable to its ability to handle giant amounts of information. The interest to use hidden layers has surpassed ancient techniques, particularly in pattern recognition. one in all the foremost well-liked deep neural networks is Convolutional Neural Networks.
 
 In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN/ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. Now when we think of a neural network we think about matrix multiplications but that is not the case with ConvNet. It uses a special technique called Convolution. Now in mathematics convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions that produces a third function that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other.
